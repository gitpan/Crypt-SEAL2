Crypt::SEAL2
============

SEAL2 is the second version of the stream cipher SEAL2, designed by Don
Coppersmith and Phillip Rogaway.

CAVEAT

SEAL2 is designed to generate up to 2^48 bytes of output per seed. In
1997, Handschuh and Gilbert showed, however, that the output stream can
be distinguished from a random sequence after only seeing roughly 2^34
bytes of output. Thus, it is prudent to avoid using the same seed for
more than 2^34 bytes of output.

BONUS

The C file, _seal2.c, is a standalone SEAL2 implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall _seal2.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.

To run the binary, type:

        ./a.out
